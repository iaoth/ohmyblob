# Oh My Blob!

_Oh My Blob!_ is a turn-based puzzle action game for PICO-8. To run, get PICO-8, ``load start.p8``, and ``run``.

The code is divided into different files. There's the event system, the blob logic, graphics, utils, titlescreen and 
the main lua file, and the two P8 carts that contain graphics and music.
